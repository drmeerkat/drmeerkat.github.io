I"ð<p>I am a first-year computer science PhD student in <a href="https://www.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a> working with <a href="https://causalai.net">Prof. Elias Bareinboim</a>. During my wonderful Masterâ€™s studies in <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>, I was fortunate enough to work with <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/">Prof. Michael Littman</a>.
