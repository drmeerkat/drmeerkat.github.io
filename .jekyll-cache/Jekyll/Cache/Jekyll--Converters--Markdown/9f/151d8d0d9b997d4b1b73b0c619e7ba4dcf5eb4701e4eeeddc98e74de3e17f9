I"[<p>I am a first-year Masterâ€™s student in <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>, working with <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/">Prof. Michael Littman</a> and <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/">Prof. George Konidaris</a>. I obtained my B.S from <a href="https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University</a>, under supervision of <a href="https://www.bigscity.com/jingyuan-wang/">Prof. Jingyuan Wang</a>.</p>

<p>My research interest lies in reinforcement learning and deep learning robustness. I studied how to defense adversarial attacks during my undergraduate when I was fascinated about learning robust cognitive machine with reliable generalization ability and low sample complexity. I want to know <strong><em><a href="http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html">how we can get so much from so little</a></em></strong> through the perspective of reinforcement learning, an abstract computational framework.</p>

<p>More specifically, I am currently focused on learning abstractions and utilizing the relational structure of obervations to achieve generalizable sample efficient agent.</p>
