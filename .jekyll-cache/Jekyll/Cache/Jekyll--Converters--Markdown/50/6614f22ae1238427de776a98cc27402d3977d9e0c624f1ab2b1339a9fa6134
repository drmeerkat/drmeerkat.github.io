I"¦<p>I am a second-year Masterâ€™s student in <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>, working with <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/">Prof. Michael Littman</a>. I obtained my B.S from <a href="https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University</a>, under supervision of <a href="https://www.bigscity.com/jingyuan-wang/">Prof. Jingyuan Wang</a>.</p>

<p>My research interest lies in reinforcement learning, especially in how to build reliable generalization and sample efficient agent. I want to know,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em><a href="http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html">how we can get so much from so little</a></em></strong> 
through the intersection of reinforcement learning and cognitive science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Currently, I focus on learning abstractions and utilizing the relational structure of observations to achieve sample efficient agent.</p>

<p>I am going to apply for 2021 Fall PhD position this semester. Shoot me an email if you have openings! Feel free to take a look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TrWBc4q3eIA7wpnXlfke-8g0FQXIZH0RFPW8lQw2LI4/edit?usp=sharing">this slide</a>, which summarizes my take on RL agents.</p>
