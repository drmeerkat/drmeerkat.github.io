I"u<p>I am an incoming PhD student in <a href="https://www.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a> working with [Prof. Elias Bareinboim][elias]. Previously, I finished my Masterâ€™s studies in <a href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a>, working with <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/">Prof. Michael Littman</a>. I obtained my B.S from <a href="https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.bigscity.com/jingyuan-wang/">Prof. Jingyuan Wang</a>.</p>

<p>My research interest lies in the intersection of causal inference and reinforcement learning, especially in how to build reliable, generalizable and sample efficient agent. Feel free to take a look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TrWBc4q3eIA7wpnXlfke-8g0FQXIZH0RFPW8lQw2LI4/edit?usp=sharing">this slide</a>, which summarizes my take on RL agents.</p>
