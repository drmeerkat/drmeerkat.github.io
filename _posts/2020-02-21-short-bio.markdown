I am a second-year Master's student in [Brown University][brown], working with [Prof. Michael Littman][litt]. I obtained my B.S from [Beihang University][buaa], under supervision of [Prof. Jingyuan Wang][jjy].  
  
My research interest lies in reinforcement learning, especially in how to build reliable generalization and sample efficient agent. I want to know ***[how we can get so much from so little][cong]*** through the intersection of reinforcement learning and cognitive science.  
  
Currently, I focus on learning abstractions and utilizing the relational structure of observations to achieve sample efficient agent.
  
I am going to apply for 2021 Fall PhD position this semester. Shoot me an email if you have openings! Feel free to take a look at [this slide][slide], which summarizes my take on RL agents.
