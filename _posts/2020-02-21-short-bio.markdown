I am a first-year computer science PhD student in [Columbia University][col] working with [Prof. Elias Bareinboim][elias]. During my wonderful Master's studies in [Brown University][brown], I was fortunate enough to work with [Prof. Michael Littman][litt]. I obtained my B.S from [Beihang University][buaa], under the supervision of [Prof. Jingyuan Wang][jjy].  
  
My research interest lies in the intersection of causal inference and reinforcement learning, especially in how to build reliable, generalizable and sample efficient agent.
