I am a first-year Master's student in [Brown University][brown], working with [Prof. Michael Littman][litt] and [Prof. George Konidaris][gkd]. I obtained my B.S from [Beihang University][buaa], under supervision of [Prof. Jingyuan Wang][jjy].  
  
My research interest lies in reinforcement learning and deep learning robustness. I studied how to defense adversarial attacks during my undergraduate when I was fascinated about learning robust cognitive machine with reliable generalization ability and low sample complexity. I want to know ***[how we can get so much from so little][cong]*** through the perspective of reinforcement learning, an abstract computational framework.  
  
More specifically, I am currently focused on learning abstractions and utilizing the relational structure of obervations to achieve generalizable sample efficient agent.
